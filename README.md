# Protein Sequence Classification with LSTM Networks using Pytorch

This repository contains Python code for performing protein sequence classification using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. LSTM networks are recurrent neural networks commonly used to process sequential data, such as protein sequences.

## Installation
### 1 - Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
### 2- Clone this repository to your computer:
```Git
git clone https://github.com/ElBaron86/Protein-Sequence-Classification-using-LSTM-with-Pytorch.git
```
### 3 - Navigate to the project directory:

```Python
cd Protein-Sequence-Classification-using-LSTM-with-Pytorch
```

### 4 -Install the necessary dependencies using pip:
```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
The data I used comes from https://www.uniprot.org/

## Usage

#### 1 Ensure that you have your protein sequence data in an appropriate format. Each protein sequence should be represented as a character sequence (e.g., "AGTCCGTA..."). If your data is in a different format, you will need to preprocess it before using it with this code.

#### 2 Place your protein sequence data in a CSV file or any other format readable by Python. Make sure that each sequence is associated with a corresponding label or class.
